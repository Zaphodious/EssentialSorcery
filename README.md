# EssentialSorcery
Open-Source Casting for Minecraft

A Minecraft mod using Forge.

The goal will be to enable casting of spells. The resource system is based on "Dragon Taps", or blocks placed in the world by a Dragonforge Wand that give a player "essence" when interacted with. These taps are "spent" when they are used, and around midnight in-game will reset (random tick updates permitting). 

Spell information forthcoming. Right now I'm working on getting the tap system functional.

If you wish to help, first order of business is to figure out why the Dragon Taps don't show up correctly in inventory. They work fine when placed into the world. (I'm not going to worry about it myself for now, as there is more important stuff to do first.) Otherwise, please contact me here.
